ACK -sA (TCP ACK scan)
It never determines open (or even open|filtered) ports. It is used to map
out firewall rulesets, determining whether they are stateful or not and
which ports are filtered.
Command: nmap -sA -T4 scanme.nmap.org

SYN (Stealth) Scan (-sS)
SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good reason. It
can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a
fast network not hampered by intrusive firewalls.
Command: nmap -p22,113,139 scanme.nmap.org

FIN Scan (-sF)
Sets just the TCP FIN bit.
Command: nmap -sF -T4 scanme.nmap.org

 NULL Scan (-sN)
Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)
Command: nmap –sN –p 22 scanme.nmap.org

 XMAS Scan (-sX)
Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a Christmas
tree.
Command: nmap -sX -T4 scanme.nmap.org
